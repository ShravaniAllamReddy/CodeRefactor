# Horiseon Website Refactor

## Description 

Code refactoring means restructuring existing code, in a way that improves the internal structure but doesn't change its external behavior.This procedure is aimed at modernizing software. It is typically used to increase the system's maintainability, enhance performance, scalability, security and so on.

This assignment is useful as I learnt how to develop a better and cleaner code by having semantic html elements where necessary and getting a bigger picture on how to use CSS float and flex.

## Usage 

If you click on any link in the Navigation bar,it navigates to the relevant section of the page.

This website is developed so that it is optimised for search engines.

## Resources used to complete this assignment

*Semantic Html elements(https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
<!-- <article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time> -->


<<<<<<< HEAD
*Use of `<span>` tag(https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_span.asp#:~:text=The%20tag%20is%20an,span%3E%20is%20an%20inline%20element )

*How to create links to sections on the same page in HTML(https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000049.htm)
In CSS, "id" is a selector that may be used to designate an area that a link should point to, similar to anchor in HTML. The nice thing about using id is that you can create a link to any element on the page, rather than only the top or bottom. 
Example:
<<<<<<< HEAD
`<a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>`
=======
`<`a href="#search-engine-optimization"`>`Search Engine Optimization`<`/a`>` 
>>>>>>> cfcf8e78377f786939f5bf306126707c17b400c0
 The above hyperlink navigates to the 'Search Engine Optimization' section on the same page.


*Hero Image(https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_hero_image.asp)


*Why background images does not have alt text(https://theme.co/forum/t/is-it-possible-to-add-an-alt-tag-to-a-background-image/48756/6)
 Since it will be background image, it cannot have an “ALT” text because a background image is a style property of an element and ALT tag is an attribute of an element.
